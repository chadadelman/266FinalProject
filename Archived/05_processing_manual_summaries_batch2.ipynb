      "A servant comes in with a letter for Edward. Old Knowell decides, as he too is called “Edward,” to read the letter and check up on his son. Stephen almost gets in a fight with the servant over nothing before exiting. Old Knowell summons Brainworm to make the servant a drink. Old Knowell reads the letter, which is from Wellbred, a roguish London gallant. It invites Edward to come and spend time at the Old Jewry, promising him that there are some unwittingly amusing people for him to meet there. Knowell is offended by the “profane and dissolute” tone of the letter and worries about Wellbred’s potential influence on his son. He worries if he’s worrying too much—“affection makes a fool / Of any man, too much the father.” Knowell summons Brainworm back into the room. He gives his servant the letter to pass on to Edward, making him promise not to tell him that he has read it—which Brainworm otherwise wouldn’t have known anyway. Brainworm exits, and Knowell resolves to “not stop” the “journey” of his son, “Nor practice any violent mean, to stay / the unbridled course of youth in him.” He says, “There is a way of winning, more by love” than “fear.”\n"
